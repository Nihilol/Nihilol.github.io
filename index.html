    My name is Oliver Liebe and I am currently a PhD student at the Section for Functional Oxides (FOX) at DTU Energy at the Technical University of Denmark. <br />

    <br />

    A litte personal information about me: I am 27 years old, and I am originally from the small town of Munkebo in Denmark. <br />
    I have been married to my wonderful wife, Caitlyn, since 2018, and we currently live in Copenhagen. <br />
    In my free time I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, cooking, and working on personal projects. <br /> 
    These projects are usually productive in nature, such as working
    on software for my work, or for example, this website.<br /> <br />
    I have always been interested in the natural sciences, and I have always been fascinated by the idea of understanding the world around us. <br />
    This fascination has led me to pursue a career in physics, and I am currently working on my PhD in the field of condensed matter physics. <br /> <br />
    While my journey is far from over, this website acts as a way for me to document my progress, experiences, and to share those experiences with others. <br />
    It is also a way for me to introduce myself in a long-format, which is difficult to do in a CV or a resume, while getting to also experiment with web development. <br /> <br />
    A compact version of the information listed on this site can be found in my <a class="linkSmall" href="files/CV_English_QDev.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>, but I will happily 
    respond to any inquiries about my work, my research, or my experiences. <br />

    I will update the site periodically, and I will also add new sections as I see fit.

    <h3>High School</h3>

    Before attending gymnasium, I took a year abroad in the United States, where I attended high school in the city of Manhattan, Kansas. <br />
    As I was planning on a career in music, the school system in the U.S. allowed me to primarily focus on music, and I was able to take classes such as music theory, 
    choral singing, and jazz band, while also being a cast member in the production of the musical "South Pacific" by Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Logan.<br /> <br /> 

    <h3>Gymnasium</h3>

    I attended gymnasium at Mulernes Legatskole in Odense, Denmark, where I majored in music. <br />
    Besides the ordinary curriculum, I also participated in the production of a locally written musical, primarily as a musician and a band member.
    I also spearheaded the creation of a practice room for the music students; the fruits of which the students still enjoy. <br /> <br /> 
    However, towards the end of my time at gymnasium, I decided to pursue a career in the natural sciences, and I subsequently took singular courses, to make up
    for the lack of natural science courses in my gymnasium education. <br /> <br />
    <h3>Bachelor's Degree</h3>

    I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Southern Denmark in 2022, where I studied under Associate Professor Francesca Serra on the topic of 
    <a class="linkSmall" href="files/Bachelors_Project_compressed.pdf">Smectic Liquid Crystals as Light-Guides.</a> <br /> <br /> 

    <h3>DESY Internship</h3>

    During the summer of 2022, I spent 2 months at the Deutches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany, where I worked on the development of a 
    <a class="linkSmall" href="files/Functional_Cellulose_Ligning_Coating_on_Porous_Materials.pdf">Functional Cellulose-Ligning Coating on 
    Porous Materials</a> under the supervision of Dr. Stefan Roth and Mr. Constantin Harder. <br /> <br /> 
    
    <h3>Master's Degree</h3>

    My Master's thesis is on the topic of
    <a class="linkSmall" href="files/Masters_Thesis_corrected_compressed.pdf">Extenisble 2xN Quantum Dot Arrays Utilising Holes in Germanium</a>
    , as a way of circumventing the scalability issue of most quantum
    computing platforms. The work was supervised by Associate professor Anasua Chatterjee and professor Ferdinand Kuemmeth. <br /> <br /> 

    <h3>PhD</h3>

    My PhD work and research area pertains to the induction of curvature in thin films of functional oxides, and the subsequent study of the effects of this curvature on the crystal 
    symmetries and properties of the materials. <br />
    My work is supervised by professor Thomas Sand Jespersen, professor Nini Pryds, and associate professor Shinhee Yun.

    <br />
    <hr id="hr_one"></hr>
    <br />

    While I have had a few odd-jobs here and there, I will only be listing the employment that started during my time at higher education institutions. <br />


    <br />

    <h3>Teaching Assistant</h3>

    I was the teaching assistant for the course "FY542 - Experimental Physics and Semi-Conductors" under Professor Sven Tougaard (Current Professor Emeritus)
    at the University of Southern Denmark, during my 3rd year as a bachelor's student. <br />
    The work included preparing and conducting exercises, grading assignments, and assisting students with their projects. 

    <br /> <br />

    <h3>Student Lab Assistant</h3>

    I was a student lab assistant at FysikLab, a physics lab at the University of Southern Denmark focussed on the engagement of high school students in physics. <br />
    This meant planning and executing experiments suitable for high school students, and assisting the students in their work. However, as most of the experiments were
    in fields previously unknown to the students, the work also included explaining the theory behind the experiments, and the physics behind the phenomena observed in small 
    lectures before the experimental section.

    <br /> <br />

    <h3>Student Coordinator</h3>

    Employed as the student coordinator of a citizen science project at the University of Southern Denmark's library, called "Globe at Night", whose goal is to increase
    public awareness of light pollution. <br />
    The work included holding public seminars on the topic of light pollution, and the effects of light pollution on the environment, as well as the celebration 
    of the 450th anniversary of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's discovery of the super nova.

    <br /> <br />

    <h3>Student Ambassador</h3>

    I was a student ambassador for the University of Southern Denmark, where I was responsible for the representation of the university to new students, as well
    as organizing events for the new students, and assisting them in their transition to university life. <br />
    These events included introductory LaTeX courses, introduction to studying abroad, how to adjust to student life, and others.
