    I received my Bachelor's of Science in Physics from the University of Southern Denmark in 2022. My Bachelor's thesis was on the topic of "Smectic Liquid Crystals as Light-Guides" 
    and was supervised by Professor Franscesca Serra. The thesis was an experimental study of the optical properties of smectic liquid crystals and their potential use as light-guides.
